# Speech & Development Companion (SDC) — Fine-Tuning Guide & Infrastructure Overview

This README provides a detailed, structured guide on how to process, analyze, and fine-tune models using `.cha` files and short audio/video recordings (<= 5 minutes each) for your Speech & Development Companion (SDC) project. It includes tools, infrastructure options, and strategies for building a context-aware speech analysis system using Whisper and LLMs.

---

## 🔎 Project Goals

- Transcribe and analyze speech recordings of children with ASD.
- Extract linguistic/acoustic features: speech rate, pitch, pauses, emotion, fluency.
- Generate insights and track progress using LLMs.
- Create personalized feedback loops for parents and therapists.

## 🧬 Key Insight: Do NOT Fine-Tune Whisper

Whisper is a robust pretrained ASR model. You should use it as-is:

- ✅ Accurate transcriptions of child/clinical speech
- ❌ Not meant for task-specific fine-tuning

Instead, feed Whisper’s output to an LLM that understands and analyzes the text.

---

## 🤖 How Will the LLM Understand Past Data?

### Option 1: ✨ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

- Use a vector database (e.g., FAISS, Weaviate, Pinecone)
- Store prior transcripts + features as embeddings
- Dynamically retrieve relevant sessions when prompting the LLM

#### Example Prompt:

> "How has Sarah's fluency changed from week 1 to week 5?"

### Option 2: 📆 Fine-Tune an Open-Source LLM (Optional)

Use your ASD session data to fine-tune models like:

- **Mistral-7B**
- **LLaMA 2 7B**
- **Phi-2 (2.7B)**
- **TinyLLaMA (1.1B)**
- **OpenHermes / OrcaMini**

#### Training Format:

```json
{
  "prompt": "Analyze this child's speech:\n\nTranscript: 'noosh ... oh no ... hai'",
  "output": "Child approximates 'nose', expresses distress, and identifies 'hair'."
}
```

## 📀 Is My Data Enough?

Yes, your data is a great start:

- 5 min of audio = ~600-800 words
- 50 samples = ~30,000-40,000 words of domain-rich, real-world ASD language data

Great for:

- Few-shot prompting
- LoRA fine-tuning
- Building retrieval indexes

## ☁️ Cloud Tools for Training

### ✅ Google Colab Pro / Pro+

- Fast prototyping (T4/A100)
- $10–$49/month
- Usage limits for long training

### 🚀 AWS SageMaker

- Managed, scalable environment
- Spot instance pricing: $1–$3/hr (g4/g5)
- LLaMA / Mistral support with HuggingFace container

### 🌀 Azure ML

- Strong GPU support (A100)
- Prebuilt HuggingFace/DeepSpeed environments
- Good for enterprise & sensitive data

### 🔬 RunPod / Modal / Replicate

- Pay-as-you-go GPU compute ($0.30–$0.60/hr)
- Prebuilt LLaMA/Mistral fine-tuning templates

### 🔹 Hugging Face AutoTrain (Pro)

- GUI-based training
- Fast setup
- Limited customization

---

## 🛠️ Fine-Tuning Strategy

### 🧵 Use LoRA / QLoRA (Lightweight Tuning)

- Saves cost + memory
- Requires fewer GPU resources

### ✏️ Format Your Data as Prompt-Response Pairs

- From `.cha` files or Whisper transcripts
- Add metadata (age, session #, context, labels)

### ⚡ Tools to Use

- `transformers` (HuggingFace)
- `trl` (for SFT, RLHF)
- `peft` (for LoRA tuning)
- `datasets` (prepare `.cha` files)
- `bitsandbytes` (4-bit quantization)

---

## ✅ Recommended Setup Path

1. Transcribe audio with Whisper
2. Extract features with `librosa` or `praat`
3. Store session metadata in MongoDB or vector DB (for RAG)
4. Build prompt-response pairs from prior data
5.  
   - Use GPT-4 + RAG for smart prompting  
   - Or fine-tune LLaMA/Mistral on RunPod/Colab
6. Generate reports & session summaries

---

## 🚀 Next Steps!

- ✍️ Convert `.cha` + Whisper transcripts to JSON
- 📝 Write fine-tuning training scripts (LoRA/QLoRA)
- 🌐 Set up Colab / RunPod notebooks
- 📊 Design progress dashboards and exportable reports
