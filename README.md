# Speech & Development Companion (SDC) üéØ

Welcome to the **Speech & Development Companion (SDC)** repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive digital tool for tracking and analyzing the developmental progress of children, particularly in the context of speech therapy and pediatric growth. It is designed to assist caregivers, parents, and therapists in understanding a child‚Äôs journey through key developmental stages, with a special focus on supporting children with autism.

## About the Project üìö

SDC combines speech analysis and general pediatric developmental tracking into a user-friendly web platform. It allows users to monitor speech therapy sessions, track developmental milestones, and gain valuable insights into a child‚Äôs progress over time. Using machine learning and NLP techniques, SDC analyzes session logs, transcribes audio recordings, and generates custom reports to provide a clear picture of a child‚Äôs growth in both communication and motor skills.

## Key Features ‚ú®

- **Pediatric Development Tracking**: Log milestones and track the progress of children in areas like language, motor skills, and cognitive development. Stay up to date with growth indicators based on well-researched benchmarks.
- **Speech Therapy Progress Analysis**: Upload audio recordings from speech therapy sessions or enter session notes manually. SDC transcribes, analyzes, and highlights key linguistic metrics like vocabulary usage, sentence structure complexity, and emotional tone.
- **Sentiment and Emotional Insight**: Gain insights into the child‚Äôs emotional state during therapy sessions with sentiment analysis. Track how emotions evolve over time, helping therapists tailor their approach to keep sessions engaging.
- **Custom Reports & Visualizations**: Generate PDF or CSV reports summarizing key progress metrics. Visualize trends over time with intuitive charts, making it easier to share updates with parents or other healthcare providers.
- **Data Privacy and Security**: SDC is built with a strong focus on data security, ensuring that sensitive information about children is securely stored and handled according to industry best practices.

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è

- **Frontend**: React.js, Chart.js/D3.js for data visualization
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB for data storage
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow/Keras, NLTK, spaCy for sentiment and speech analysis
- **Hosting**: AWS (S3 for file storage, EC2 for hosting), AWS Lambda for serverless processing
